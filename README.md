This repository contains automated API testing scripts built with MochaJS, Chai, and Supertest, designed to demonstrate structured and maintainable API test automation.

The tests use the public API from Reqres.in
 â€” a free hosted REST API ideal for learning and testing HTTP requests.
All test cases validate both positive and negative responses, including status codes, response time, and JSON payload structure.
